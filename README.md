## Using verbose NOR dumps..

Since certain versions of the NOR dumps are not all compatible with specific iOS versions, when flashing the custom NOR dump, ipwndfu backs up your original NOR.
This is because not all dumps are cross-compatible which means if you're stuck in a boot-loop, just flash your backed up NOR dump to get rid of the boot-loop.

This is VERY useful if your using other people's NOR.
